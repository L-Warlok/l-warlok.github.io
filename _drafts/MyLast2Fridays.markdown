title: My Last 2 Fridays
---

Since about February(I think) I've been going to bachata lessons on Friday nights. At first some of the other ELS's were coming with me but they all gave up after about 4 classes, so the rest I've been by myself. 

# 29th of April
For the first time in 3 months, someone spoke to me after class and we had a conversation. They then invited me out for dinner with them which was nice enough. 

Afterwards they invited me out dancing with them. I didn't really want to go because they were all about double my age, but I went anyway. We ended up a dancing club nearby, and just as I expected they were all wayy better than me at dancing, and all about 200 years old. I was there for about an hour and I danced once, but I wasn't really in the mood.

# 1 week later
A different group invited me out this time, and they're all a lot younger than the first bunch which was good. One of them really loves Australia and wants to live there so he spent most of the time asking questions. 

Afterwards, they gave me a lift home, and on the way they invited me to an event that was on the next night at the dance school. 

# The next day
Because eveything in Spain starts 2 hours later than it does anywhere else in the world, I finished watching a movie at midnight, and while the rest of my family went to bed, I walked to the school. 

The others got there a few minutes later
