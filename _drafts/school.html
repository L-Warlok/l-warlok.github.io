<p>My first day of high school in Venezuela was on Wednesday the 30th of January. It was an interesting day, to say the least.</p>
<p>I'll start off with a comparison between my school in Australia and my school here(who doesn't love a foreigner who makes excessive comparisons between their home and host countries, right? ) OK, so in Australia, there were about 180 guys in my year group(in case you didnt know, I went to Trinity College in Perth, a Catholic boys school) and the average class size was around 25 students. Here, there are 19 other people in my year group and we're all in the same class. Because there's only one class, we stay in the same room for the whole day, and the teachers have to switch rooms. And now we come to the teachers. Out of 6 teachers, only 2 of them can actually control the class. On a good day. The rest of the time the lessons just go straight out the window. Whole class sing alongs are almost a daily occurrence. One thing that I have found surprising, despite the fact that no one does very much work at all, is that the work they do do is pretty difficult. The stuff that I understand(maths and physics) are both almost equivalent in difficulty to the top maths and physics courses in Australia.</p>
