My last day of school was Tuesday the 21st of June. The english teachers threw me a leaving party and bought me a Barcelona FC shirt so I was pretty stoked with that.

Thursday the 24th was Saint John's Eve or Sant Joan here in Catalonia, which is a celebration where kids get to light a bunch of firecrackers and end up throwing them at each other and they have a bonfire in every suburb. 

My host family have a house rented in a small village near the Pyrenes called Sant Julia de Cerdanyola where they spend easter and other holidays when they want to get away from the city so I went there with them from Thursday evening until Sunday. The village has around 200 permanent residents but during holidays that can rise to over 1000.

The first night was more or less what I just described, a bunch of kids lighting firecrackers and throwing them at each other with a bonfire in the background. 

The next day I woke up late and went for a walk with my parents to see the town.  I have some photos from the walk so I'll upload them here sometime.

The pool opened for the first 
It was the first day the pool was open this year so it was free entry, and we walked there after seeing the town. Had a beer, ate some bravas and then went back to the house for lunch (y).

In the afternoon I read my book and then went to the pool. The water was cold because they take it from a river that runs down from the mountains and the heating hadn't kicked in yet, but I went for a swim and then back to the house.

At night I read my book and then went to bed. 


## Saturday
Woke up late again and read some more. My host mum went to a nearby town to buy something so I went with her and we had a look around there too. 

My host grandparents had come for the weekend so when we got back lunch was ready so we ate and then went to the pool. 

After dinner I read my book more and then went to bed but after not enough sleep the last few nights I knew I was going to be sick the next day. 

## Sunday
Surprise Surprise, I was sick on Sunday. I'm counting this the second time I've been sick on this trip thanks to being too tired which is entirely my own fault and that makes it worse.
