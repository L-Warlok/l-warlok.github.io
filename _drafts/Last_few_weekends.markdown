June 3/4/5 was the weekend of the Catalan MotoGP and people here are pretty crazy about it. Some of my host family were going and I was interested so I went as well. 

The event was on from Friday to Sunday but the first 2 days were for testing and stuff so we only went on Sunday.

We planned to leave at 8 and ended up leaving at about quarter past 8. The track, like everything in Catalonia, is about an hour from my house. The closer we got the more traffic there was and we ended up parking further away and walking to get there. 

The first race was already started as we were walking to our seats at about 12.

Moto3 started soon after we sat down, then after moto2 we went for a walk around and took some photos before sitting down for the main event.

Marc Marquez is from a town right near here and he's currently one of the best riders in the world so a lot of local supporters had made the trek to watch him on his home circuit. 

The race was decent, but Rossi pretty much swept the floor with the rest of the field. Marquez overtook him for probably 1 lap but couldn't hold the lead and Rossi won.

## Another day
School has more or less been finished for a few weeks now. In the last week of class the students do a project that's meant to consolidate the things they've done during the year so I didn't have to go to class. Then they all had a trip for 3 days to do more stuff for the project. 

The final day of the year was a trip to a theme park called Port Aventura, about an hour and a half away from Manresa. I've never really been a fan of theme parks but I still wanted to go and see it. 

When we got there one of the teachers told me he had a wrist band that lets him go on all of the rides with another person without having to wait in lines. Usually this band costs 50$$ eUro per person but he got it free because he had a stroke a few years ago and that's one of the benefits he gets with his medical card. 

So I went with this teacher and another to do as many rides as we could. At one place they eventually kicked us out and told us to wait because we went so many times in a row. 

It was a good day.

That night was the graduation dinner of the final year class because they'd finished all their exams. I was invited too. The venue was a club that does dinners in the evenings and opens as a club at 12. We got there at 9 and it was meant to start at 9:15 but some of the parents were super late and we didn't sit down to eat til around 10:30. Unfortunately the food was average, but the venue was good and the company decent too so it ended up as a pretty decent night. Some of the students were staying later and I stayed too and we had a good time, I ended up getting home at 6am.
