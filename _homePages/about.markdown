Hi, my name's Luke and I'm a third year Mechatronic Engineering Student at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.

I'm currently on a student exchange in Catalonia, Spain, working as an English language assistant. I have quite a lot a free time here so I'm currently learning:

* To play with websites;
* Object-Orientation through Java;
* Android development;
* Vim and;
* Polish.


## Find me elsewhere:

* [GitHub]({{ site.github }})
* [LinkedIn]({{ site.linkdin }})
