Hi, my name's Luke and I'm a third year Mechatronic Engineering Student at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.

I'm currently on a student exchange in Catalonia, Spain, working as an English language assistant. I have quite a lot a free time here so I'm currently learning:

* To play with websites;
* Object-Orientation through c++(no h8 pls);
* Android development and;
* Polish.

<!-- This section will hopefully one day contain a more complete description of my achievements but for now I'll stick to some social media profiles
 so if you want to get in touch let me know through here: -->
