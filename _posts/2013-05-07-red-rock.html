<p>7th May</p>
<p>Today was the day we were leaving our first accommodation in La Gran Sabana. The next place wasn't too far away, only a few hours drive, so rather than waste a whole day driving, we stopped at a few places along the way. </p>
<p>All of the places we went to were small waterfalls, usually with places to swim at the bottom. One of these that was really cool, you could climb behind, and see through(actually this happened yesterday, but I forgot to put it in the post so I thought I'd write it here instead of editing the other one). I had my camera with me, so I took a few photos, and some video that I'll upload later. Another wasn't for swimming, as after the fall, the water flowed over an almost flat bed of red and black rock for about 50 metres. The bed was maybe 10 metres wide, so the water wasn't deep, but the current was strong. Apparently there wasn't usually as much water as when we went there, but it had been raining for a few days before we got there. Carlos, the youth exchange coordinator from the other district said that when there wasn't as much water, and the sun hit the rock, it lit up a beautiful, vivid red colour and started almost glowing. Unfortunately we didn't get to see it, but it was still a cool spot to visit.</p>
<p>That was the last thing we visited, before heading to our next accommodation. I don't know the exact name of the town where we were staying, but the hotel was really cool. There were pool, air hockey and ping pong tables, and a few chess and dominoe boards to play on, so everyone had a good time on the first night we were there. That was pretty much all we did for the few hours before bed, so it was a good ending to a good day.</p>
