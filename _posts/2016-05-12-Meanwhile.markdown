So it's been a while since I've written and I've been meaning to write again for a while now but I've been busy doing things.

## Sant Jordi
Sant Jordi, or Saint George, is the patron saint of Catalonia, and his day is the 23rd of April.
In Catalonia they celebrate a festival called Sant Jordi, which is like their version of Valentine's day. It's based on a legend about a dragon.

Unfortunately I was sick on this day, but I still wanted to see the festival so I went to Barcelona anyway. I slept most of the way there on the train because I slept poorly the night before but when I arrived I was still tired. 

It was about 2PM when I arrived at the Plaza de Cataluña, where I quickly met up with Jenefer and Rachel who had come earlier in the day. The had procured free tickets to the Güell Palace, a mansion near Les Rambles designed by Gaudí during the late 19th century for Eusebi Güell, so when went to see that. 

All the way along Les Rambles florists and book shops set up there stalls for people to buy roses and books for their loved ones. This area is already pretty busy on a normal day, so with this massive festival it was packed. I didn't buy anything because I don't like spending money but it was interesting to see.

Next we went to eat, at a random Irish style pub because it was kind of cheaper than the other places we saw. I don't think I'd go back there because the food was shit.

By this stage it was about 5-6, and the girls wanted to go and see a fair that was on near the beach to the north. We caught the metro there and just as we got off it started to rain. By this stage I was already wearing both of my jumpers and didn't want to get wet so we walked quickly to the fair and had a look around. I think I probably should have realised this before agreeing to go there but the carnival, like all carnivals, was pretty much filled with the Spanish equivalent of bogans. Once I realised this, and that there would be nothing there for me to see, I say down and waited while the girls went and had a look around. 

It was now around 8PM and I was making plans to head home. By the time the others got back it was time for us to leave if we were going to catch the bus I wanted but one of them didn't have cash for the ticket and kicked up a fuss about me being in a rush, so I ended up going home by myself while they looked for somewhere to take cash out. 
My plan had been to catch a bus back to Manresa, but all of my connections were running late so I ended up catching the train instead.

I got home at about 11, ate and went to bed.
