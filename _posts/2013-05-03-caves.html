<p>Today we got up at 6:30 to eat at 7 before going to introduce ourselves to the rotary conference. This was much less daunting than I was expecting, because it was just that, an introduction. I had previously been told that we were to present on our home countries at the conference, and I wasnt prepared for that at all, so everything went better than expected.</p>
<p>We then got on a bus to go to the Alejandro Humboldt national park. The drive was longer than anyone thought it would be, taking about 3 hours, but it wasn't a bad trip. The cave was pretty cool, but my camera ran out of battery and my phone wasn't quite up to taking photos in a pitch black cave so I dont have many photos, but I'm going to try and poach some from the others so it should be all good.</p>
<p>On the way back a powerline broke and fell onto the road so we spent about 7 hours I think, sitting in the bus waiting for someone to come and fix it because it was live, and we didn't want to die.</p>
<p>When we finally got back we went to a restaurant to eat and then went to bed almost straight away because we had an early morning the next day.</p>
<p>On saturday we drove to La Gran Sabana, so there's not too much to tell. The drive was meant to take 10 or 11 hours I think, but it took around 13 because we stopped a few times. That was kinda annoyong because I'd rather drive straighy through to end the driving as quickly as possible. Thems the breaks with a big group I guess. It's all good though, everyone here is super cool and easy to talk to, so the bus rides are enjoyable.</p>
<p>We arrived at 9 I think, and after dinner and a quick briefing on the rules, went to bed.</p>
