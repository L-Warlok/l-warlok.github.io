<p>So I'm off on a new adventure. This time I'm living in Catalonia for 6 months working as an English language assistant. So far I've been here for 1 week and it's been absolutely wicked. My host family picked me up from Barcelona international airport at about 9pm on Wednesday the 6th of January. The whole family was there, mum, dad, 2 brothers and a sister. They live in a city called Manresa, about 50km north west of Barcelona and it takes an hour to drive there. The first night we got home, ate and I went to bed exhausted.</p>
<p>The next day was my host brother's birthday. I got to meet some of the family who came to wish him a happy birthday and I went to a neighbouring town to drop him at soccer training. A relatively quiet day because I was still jet-lagged as hell.</p>
<p>Friday<br />
Went for a walk in the city and of course everything is so different. I haven't taken any photos yet but there's still time. The city centre is a rats nest of walking/1 way cobbled alleyways with shops onÂ either side.<br />
Next we went to someone else's birthday party and I realised that their family is enormous and it's always going to be someone's birthday. Got home late(for me) from the party at about 9 and had pizza for dinner which is a family tradition on Friday nights.</p>
<p>Saturday<br />
Went to host dad's parents place for family lunch and then to watch my brother play soccer.</p>
<p>Sunday<br />
Went to host mum's parents farm for family lunch. This region is awesome. You can drive 5 minutes and be in a rural area a day drive 5 more minutes and be in another town.</p>
<p>My first day of school. Honestly I was packing my daks a bit about the first day because I wasn't sure what to expect but I think overall it went pretty well. I forgot 9001 people's names and answered the same questions 9001 times and then went home.</p>
<p>Today Wednesday 13th Jan<br />
The high school days here go class 8-11, breakfast(2nd breakfast, it's like they're hobbits or something) 30mins, class 11:30-2:30. Today the teachers invited me to breakfast at a nearby cafe and I went with them.<br />
After school I went to my host grandparent's for lunch, and then went for a walk in the city by myself for a few hours. I sat in a park on a hill and looked at stuff, and I went into a few shops looking for jackets because I need a jacket because it's bloody cold here.</p>
