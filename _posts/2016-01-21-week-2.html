<p>My first school week ended pretty well. I'm happy that I don't have to do my presentation again for a while because it got old realÂ quick. Friday was the best school day because I have a class with the final year students and some of them are almost my age and they all speak English so the class was fun.</p>
<p>The best part of Friday though was meeting the other ELAs also inÂ Manresa. We went out to a cafe in the city and I had a hot chocolate so thick the spoon stood up in it.</p>
<p>The weekend was the same as last week.</p>
<p>This Monday was the first day of me actually teaching an English lesson and it went relatively well.</p>
<p>I went to the gym for the first time on Monday too.</p>
<p>Tuesday and Wednesday nights I went shopping for pants and jumpers and I've bought one jumper so far.</p>
<p>Today one of the teachers organised a welcome party for me at break time which was a pleasant surprise. I got to forget a bunch more people's names so that was fun.</p>
<p>I also made a Spanish bank account.</p>
