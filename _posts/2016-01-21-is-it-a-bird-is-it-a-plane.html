<p>No I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>To be honest I don't really know where this blog's going. I feel like part of the reason I stopped writing last time was that I couldn't be bothered writing well all the time. For that reason I'm just going to see where this goes and it might even just end up as dot points for myself. You're all welcome to read it if you'd like, but I don't think I'm going to share anything on social media so good luck finding it without a link fromÂ something else.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm going to be updating on Wednesdays when I can, and Thursdays otherwise.</p>
