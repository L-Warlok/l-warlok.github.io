<p>5th of May</p>
<p>Today we got up early, again. After breakfast, we went 4wdriving to get to a river. I don't think you can describe my utter euphoria over the fact that we were going off-road here, it's possibly the highlight of the trip so far.</p>
<p>We went in the cars to an indigenous village, where we then literally left the road to go upriver to the edge of a waterfall in canoes(with motors.) When we left the canoes there were a few native tour guide people waiting to show us the way though the nearby jungles and stuff. While we were walking to the first waterfall, the guide stopped at a termite nest so we could taste termite. They weren't bad. Next stop was the top of a big waterfall so we could take photos. This was the biggest waterfall I'd ever seen, but apparently Angel falls is 10 times higher. After a lot of photos, we started walking down to the bottom of the waterfall. When we got to the bottom, we got changed into bathers to go closer to the bottom because there was a lot of spray, enough to get everyone soaked. After more photos, we started walking along the river to find other falls and swim in the natural pools created at the bottom of old waterfalls. These were pretty cool to swim in and jump into, but the water was really cold.</p>
<p>After swimming for a while in some different pools, we went back to the camp site place where we were staying and ate, before going to bed.</p>
