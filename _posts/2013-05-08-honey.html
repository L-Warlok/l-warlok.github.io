<p>8th of May</p>
<p>Today we went 4wdriving again. Again it was really fun because we went through some rough terrain. This time we were going to climb one of the mountains that are characteristic of this area of Venezuela. They're like normal mountains, if a little steep, until about half way up when they just go vertical, like cliffs. Then on the top they're just flat, with trees and stuff growing. I'd like to know how they formed, because their shape is really interesting. The particular ones we climbed today are apparently the oldest rocks in the world, though I'm not too sure exactly what that means. It was a nice spot, but there were lots of clouds so we couldn't see too far across the land, which was a shame. </p>
<p>The highlight of this day for me was on the way home, when we stopped at a cafe/shop thing and I bought some really good honey. It was so good that I used a substantial amount on the spot, on peoples cakes, in coffee, and on chocolate, all of which I was then <em>oblige</em>d to try.</p>
<p>We then went back to the hotel place where we were staying, and messed around for a bit, talked a bit and danced a bit before going to sleep.</p>
