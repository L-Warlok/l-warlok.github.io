<p>6th of May</p>
<p>I think this was more meant to be a relaxation day than anything else, as we didn't really do too much. After breakfast we went to a few different smaller waterfalls and rapids and things, to swim. They were all pretty cool, but not really spectacular like the day before.</p>
<p>The highlight of this day was a game of soccer that we played with some of the local indigenous community. It wasn't a bad game, but I didn't play too well. The final score was 4-3, with 2 goals being scored in the last 10 minutes to secure victory for the exchange students.</p>
<p>Not much else happened that day, so we sat around talking til we went to bed.</p>
