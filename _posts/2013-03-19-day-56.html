<p>Yeah I know it's kinda late to be starting a blog now, and that I should have done it from the start but I didn't so you're just going to have to deal with it. From now on I'll try and post fairly regularly, and I'll also be filling in the gaps from the last 2 months(it might take a while, but they'll be thereÂ eventually.) Well, now that that's out of the way, let's begin.</p>
<p>Day #56<br />
It's Tuesday today and the sun is shinning down from the cloudless perfect blue sky onto the paradise that is the island of daisies. There's no school today, because it's a religious holiday for the area where the school is, but I still have cooking class in the afternoon. That works just perfectly for me because it means I got to sleep in, skip the boring normal school and cook in the afternoon :D Today we have a seafood lesson, with prawns, squid, octopus and some other swimmy things that I can remember just now, so it should be awesome(it's always awesome) Photos to come later, on my facebook.</p>
